# 2d_game_tryout
A 2D game developped with godot following an [YouTube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0).

Just wanted to have a taste of gamedev with godot...

A screenshot of the game (one can hardly call this a game)

## To Play
Download the game.exe on your windows machine, and run it :)
